                    <p>The challenge was helping small farmers' producers to reduce time and resources when they needed
                        to
                        spray
                        pesticides in their plantations and receive other important information about their region.

                    <p>In this project, I was responsible for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Design Strategy</li>
                        <li>Product Design</li>

                    <p>Brazilian farmers don't have money and resources, and they always try to not waste them. </p>
                    <p>The project was fully funded by Sebrae, which is a huge social institution that helps the
                        development
                        of micro and small enterprises. </p>
                    <p>The company offers the app totally free for any user.</p>

                    </h4>

                    <p>We started trying to understand the problem, so we started to make a basic field research. </p>
                    <p> So, we went to a region full of small farmers' properties and ask them what costs more, or
                        what is more expensive in their job. </p>
                    <p>They said that the weather and the time to spray pesticides were the most painful and spendable.
                        At
                        this point, we discovered what is the features that we will apply. </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>So, what came to me was these results:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p> Farmers don't know when it's the best time to spray the pesticides; </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p> Small farms must know what is the best time to spray; </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p> A common issue for small farmers in Brazil, because weather changes and small farmers
                                waste
                                a lot of resources and money; </p>
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="h3">Competitive Analysis </h4>
                    <p>So, based on these results, I started to search competitors, to understand if this question
                        already has a solution. </p>
                    <p>To my surprise, I didn't find a bunch of competitors, and what I found
                        was just English information (Brazilians speak Portuguese) those solutions seem to be adaptable
                        to foreigners' info, and most parts of the information it's not easy to understand. Also, based
                        on user feedback, we know that they don't use any kind of app or solution.</p>

                    <h4>Primary hypothesis </h4>

                        see the main hypothesis: Is that really useful?</p>

                    <h4>Primary research</h4>
                    <p>I decided to move with simple paper research, with qualitative and open questions, and we had a
                        chance to make this in a huge rural event in a state in Brazil.</p>
                    <p><strong>The questions were:</strong> </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>How do you know when is the best time to spray pesticides? How important is this
                            information?</li>
                        <li>Do you use any type of application or service? If yes, how does it help you?</li>
                        <li>How do you know about the occurrence of pests in your region? How important is this
                            information?</li>

                    <p>Totally 30 farmers, and 120 qualitative answers, were collected. After that, we compile the
                        answers and transform into numbers:</p>

                        can work with the product owner to make this more real, but I think this is a good start when I
                        started to create the user experience. So the metrics were:</p>
                    <ul>

                            Help users to save up to 30% of resources (Using Survey (Qualitative));

                        <li>
                            Customer Satisfaction Score around 70% (NPS or survey helps to understand (Quantitative));
